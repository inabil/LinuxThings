Isn't everything involving Linux cool? I live in Sweden but had traveled to Morocco to visit my wife's family. While there, I had a problem with the bank.

Recycled bare-bones refurbished PCs by installing Linux and saving a bundle of money because of sharply reduced hardware costs.

My ISP doesn't allow me to have more than one machine connected to the same Internet connection after I use port forwarding for my own home LAN.

It creates a second terminal so two people can be logged in to the computer at the same time [like Linux and Unix are supposed to do. I'm typing on that terminal. That's because my 12-yo grandson is on my main keyboard and screen in a Google Plus Hangout with his friend, screen-sharing his running program “Wizards 101”, which is a Windows game running under wine. If that ain't cool, I don't know what is.
